# COVID Plots with data from usafacts

This was inspired by the excellent countrywise plots by Max Salvatore, link: https://github.com/maxsal/covid_19, and link to the Shiny app: [https://mmsalva.shinyapps.io/covid_19/_w_dd771aab/#]

Here I scrape data from USA facts website and Statewise cases and deaths plot from USA facts website, here: https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/
